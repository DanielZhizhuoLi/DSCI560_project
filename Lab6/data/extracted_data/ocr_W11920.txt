DETAILS OF WORK
Nance Petroleum request permission to permanently abandon the Red River and production test the Duperow
A previous workover In May and June 1999 attempted to stimulate the Red River, but failed due to collapsed
casing In the Prairie Salt and Dunham formations Communication was lost with the producing zone dunng the
workover due to salt plugs in the various fish left in the well. See the attached wellbore schematic
Approximately $156,000 was spent trying to re-establish production from the Red River. The well has salted off
again and Is not productive. We propose to spot 30 sx Class ‘G’ cement on top of the Model 'D’ packer to
permanenlly abandon the Red River Due to the tight casing in the Dunham, 6661’, we can not get a retainer in
the well, and with out communication with the perfs, we can nol get a Squeeze. We request 8 verbal approval
as we intend 1o start this work this week due to lease expirations

March 8, 1996
Ms. Jan Magstadt
Panterra Petroleum
P. 0. Box 7168
Billings, MT 59103-7168
Dear Ms. Magstadt:
Panterra Petroleum filed with the Industrial Commission on
March 7, 1996 an application for a Stripper Well Property
Determination for its Corps of Engineers #31-10 well (Well File
#11920, API #33-053-02148) located in the NW NE 10-153N-101W,
McKenzie County, North Dakota.
Information contained in the application indicates that the
above mentioned well is a property pursuant to statute and rule,
and Panterra Petroleum has elected to designate said well as a
separate property for stripper well purposes. Also, the well
produces from a well depth of more than 10,000 feet. During the
twelve consecutive months qualifying period January 1995 thru
December 1995, the well produced at a maximum efficient rate, and
the average daily production from the well was 27.9 barrels of oil
per day.
It is therefore determined that the above mentioned well
qualifies as a "Stripper Well Property” pursuant to Section
57-51.1-01 NDCC.
This determination is applicable only to the Red River Pool
in and under said property.
The Commission shall have continuing jurisdiction, and shall
have the authority to review the matter. The determination may be
amended or rescinded by the Commission for good cause.
Sincerely,
dt Be 7 y
