Control Wells
Two completed wells were used as control offsets on Chalmers 5300 31-19H,
The Wade Federal 5300 21-30H [SW NW Section 30, TIS53N, RIOOW] is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis
Petroleum North America, LLC. It was spud 5 April 2011 and drilled to a total depth of 20,482’ into the
Middle Bakken Formation. Wade Federal 5300 21-30H is located approximately 0.7 miles South of
Chalmers 5300 31-19H, tis still operated by Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC.
The Kline Federal 5300 11-I8H [NW NW Section 18, TI53N, Ri00W] is a horizontal well drilled by Oasis
Petroleum North America, LLC. It was spud 7 May 2011 and drilled to a total depth of 20,650 into the
Middle Bakken Formation. Kline Federal 5300 [1-18H is located approximately 1.5 miles North of
Chalmers 5300 31-I9H. itis stul operated by Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC.
During the curve, the gamma ray that was produced was constantly compared to the Wade Federal 5300 21-
30H and Kline Federal 5300 1/-18H wells. Gamma ray was used to help determine a proper landing depth.
To assist in the choosing of an initial target, an isopach table (Table 1) was constructed to
measure the distance of formation tops to the target depth determined from the offset well.
Comparison of gamma ray markers showed the most consistent isopach for up hole formations to
be the Base of Charles Salt.

Lithology
The top of the “False Bakken” was penetrated at a measured depth of 10,696’ (TVD 10,550’) (-
8,621") suggesting a target depth of 10,590’ TVD.
The Upper Shale of the Bakken Formation [Missippian — Devonian] was drilled at 10,736’
(10,566 TVD) (-8,637’) with sample returns of black, carbonaceous, and petroliferous shale
(Figure 5) characterized by gamma ray values in excess of 255 API counts, Gas levels rose
sharply through the Upper Shale, increasing from a background of ~400 units to over 1300 units,
and then receded to ~830 units.
Samples were described as:
SHALE: very dark gray to brown, sub blocky to blocky, friable to firm, smooth hard,
waxy texture, calcareous, occasional disseminated pyrite, no visible oil stain

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a waiver from the tubing/pkr requirement included in
NDAC 43-02-03-21: Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately
following the upcoming fracture stimulation.
The following assurances apply:
1. The well is equipped with new 29# & 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi
2. The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure,
3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment.
4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job.
5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates.
6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing.
7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-
55. Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small
drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of
the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the
terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing
or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well
pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if
the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.

Dear ROBIN E. HESKETH:
North Dakota Century Code (NDCC) Section 38-08-04 provides for the preservation of cores and samples and their
shipment to the State Geologist when requested. The following is required on the above referenced well:
1) All cores, core chips and samples must be submitted to the State Geologist as provided for the NDCC Section 38-
08-04 and North Dakota Administrative Code 43-02-03-38.1.
2) Samples shall include all cuttings from:
Base of the Last Charles Salt
Samples of cuttings shall be taken at 30' maximum intervals through all vertical, build and horizontal sections.
Samples must be washed, dried, packed in sample envelopes in correct order with labels showing operator, well
name, location and depth, and forwarded in standard boxes to the State Geologist within 30 days of the
completion of drilling operations.
3) Cores: ALL CORES cut shall be preserved in correct order, properly boxed, and forwarded to the State Geologist
within 90 days of completion of drilling operations. Any extension of time must have written approval from the
State Geologist.
4) All cores, core chips, and samples must be shipped, prepaid, to the State Geologist at the following address:
ND Geological Survey Core Library
Campus Road and Cornell
Grand Forks, ND 58202
5) NDCC Section 38-08-16 allows for a civil penalty for any violation of Chapter 38 08 not to exceed $12,500 for
each offense, and cach day’s violation is a separate offense.
Sincerely
Ze

NOTE: A Gamma Ray log must be run to ground surface and a CBL must be run on intermediate or longstring casing string if set.
Surveys are required at least every 30 feet in the build section and every 90 feet in the lateral section of a horizontal well. Measurement
inaccuracies are not considered when determining compliance with the spacing/drilling unit boundary setback requirement except in the
following scenarios: 1) When the angle between the well bore and the respective boundary is 10 degrees or less and the well bore is within
150 feet of the respective setback requirement; or 2) If industry standard methods and equipment are not utilized. Consult the applicable field
order for exceptions.
If measurement inaccuracies are required to be considered, a 2° MWD measurement inaccuracy will be applied to the horizontal portion of the well
bore. This measurement inaccuracy is applied to the well bore from KOP to TD.
