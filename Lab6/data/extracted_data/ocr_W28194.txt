The Bakken Formation
The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian] was recorded at 10,963' MD, 10,759’ TVD (-8,602'
MSL). Entry into this member is characterized by high gamma counts (>300 API), elevated background
gas and increased rates of penetration. While drilling through the Upper Bakken Shale gas a background
gas of 580u was observed, as well as several gas shows exceeding 800u. The distinct black shale is
carbonaceous and petroliferous, as well as, hard and platy. Minerals including disseminated/nodular pyrite
and trace calcite fracture fill was observed.
The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was
entered at 11,020’ MD, 10,774' TVD (-8,617' MSL). Samples in
the Middle Bakken are predominantly a light brown, light brown
gray, light to medium gray, silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is
fine to very fine grained, and firm. The Middle Bakken typically
contained sub-round to sub-angular grains. Samples are smooth,
moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare to trace
quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite is present as was
trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium
brown, spotty oil stain was visible in many of these samples.
While drilling the Middle Bakken background gasses ranged from
~700 to 3500 units while several shows exceeded 4500u.
Figure 3. Wet sample cuttings of silty sandstone from the Middle Bakken.
Geosteering
Structure maps provided by Oasis Petroleum projected the structure would have an overall down dip
averaging -0.50º. Below are the two nearest offset wells to the Lewis Federal 5300 21-31 5B. The Lewis
Federal 5300 11-21 4BR (Figure 4), drilling west to east, ~0.30 miles north of the subject well, and the
Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H (Figure 5), drilling west to east, ~0.20 miles south of the subject well.
Although the nearby offsets all had an overall dip rate of -0.50º, the structure near a vertical section of
4,700’ varied considerably. The Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H has a very consistent downward dip rate of
approximately -0.50 throughout the course of the lateral. While the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR has a
constant downward dip rate until ~4,700’ vertical section, where the structure abruptly dips down at a steep
>2º for several hundred feet before flattening, reversing to a steep >1.5º up dip for several hundred feet,
then returning to dip rate more similar to that of regional structure. In total the synclinal structure observed
on the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR lasted for ~1,950’. The steering team recognized that if the structure
on the subject well was to be irregular, and similar to the Lewis Federal 5300 11-21 4BR, that this irregular
structure would be observed from 4,000’-7,000’ vertical section.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum respectfully requests to amend the surface casing depth to 3300' MD (previously (2157') due to
potential flowback In the Dakota formation. In order to counteract projected flowback at surface, Oasis needs to
increase mud weight, and lowering the surface casing point will allow this to be performed safely. ADV tool will not
be used.
Attached are revised drill plans reflecting the amended casing points, cement volumes, and other related volumes.

Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a variance to NDAC 43-02-03-21 for the tubing/packer requirement:
Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately following the upcoming
fracture stimulation.
The following assurances apply:
1. the well is equipped with new 29# and 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi;
2. The Frac design will ise a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure;
3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by montioring equipement;
4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flowback than during the frac job;
5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates;
6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing;
7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC
43-02-03-55. Oasis Intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a
small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations
of the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting Into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drllling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an Initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not Intended to alter or extend
the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage In or under the
spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction If the well
pad is located In a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site
if the well ls not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.
Oasis must notify NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn @701-770-3554 with spud and TD.
