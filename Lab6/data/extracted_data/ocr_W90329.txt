API Rating & Safety Factor
a) Collapse based on full casing evacuation with 9 ppg fluid on backside (2159' setting
b) Burst pressure based on 9 ppg fluid with no fluid on backside (2159' setting depth)
c) Based on string weight In 9 ppg fluid at 2159’ TVD plus 100k# overpull (Buoyed weight
equals 67k ibs)
Cement volumes are based on 9-5/8" casing set in 13-1/2 ” hole with 60% excess to circulate cement back to surface
