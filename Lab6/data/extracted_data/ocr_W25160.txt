DETAILS OF WORK
Continental Resources, Inc. requests a waiver from the tubing/pkr requirement included in NDIC 43-02-03-21: Casing,
Tubing, and Cementing Requirements during the completion period immediately following the upcoming fracture
stimulation. The following assurances apply:
1) The well is equipped with 26#/ft P-110 7" casing at surface with an API burst rating of 9960 psig for the 26 #/ft
casing.
2) The frac design will use a safety factor of 0.85 * API burst rating to determine the max pressure.
3) Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by monitoring equipment.
4) The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flow back than during the frac job.
5) The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates
6) Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing.
7) A 300# gauge will be installed on surface casing during flowback period.

DETAILS OF WORK
Continental Resources, Inc. requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well
under NDAC 43-02-03-55 •. Continental Resources, Inc. intends to drlll the surface hole with freshwater based drilling
mud and set surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth
pre-approved by the NDIC per the Applfcation for Permit to Drill NDAC 43·02-03-21. No saltwater will be used In the
drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing Is cemented, a plug or mechanical
seal wlll be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting Into the well. A rig capable of
drilling to TD wlll move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing
plan as per the APO. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance
with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02..03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings
and time savings of using an Initial rig that Is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not
intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obllgatlon under, any oil and gas lease with
acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Contlnental Resources, Inc.
understands NDAC 43-02.03·31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The drllllng pit will
be fenced Immediately after construction ifthe well pad is located In a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1).
Continental Resources, Inc. wlll plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if the well ls not drilled by the
larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drllllng rig.

Re: Continental Resources standard CCL, CBL, 4-1/2” liner running and testing procedures
Continental Resources’ standard practice for running the cement bond log and casing
caliper log is to run both logs immediately after coming out of the hole after TD, prior to running
the 4-1/2” liner, to the deepest depth obtainable; however, if there are well control concerns that
require us to run the liner sooner, only the CBL will be run and the CCL will be run after setting
the liner.
Based on the CCL results, we determine the actual API minimum burst allowance for the 7”
casing. If the downgraded API burst pressure is below our minimum required frac pressures, we
will run a 4-1/2” frac string; if severe wear or holes are found in the casing, we will run a 5”
cemented, to surface, tie back string.
The CBL log is run in order to determine the top of cement, as required by the NDIC.
Our current 4-1/2” liner program for a 1280 unit is 30, evenly spaced, stages with 29 swellable
packers. The liner shoe is set approximately 180 feet off bottom. The shoe stage below the last
packer has 2 joints, a double valved float, one joint, and a ported guide shoe – appx 130 ft. The
liner is run using a running tool on the end of 4” DP. The 7” packer/hanger is set about 40 ft
above KOP between two casing collars but conditions occasionally occur that require setting
higher, either through unexpected failure or in order to isolate casing wear close to KOP.
Recently we have tried 40 stage liners and the trend to explore the optimum stage count will
continue.. Once the liner is at depth, a ball is dropped through the DP, the ball is pressured up
against the setting tool to approximately 2500 psi, and the 7” packer/hanger is set.
A push pull test is done to confirm the hanger has set. Then, a 4500 psi pressure test is
completed on the back side of the 4” DP to confirm the packer has set. The setting tool is then
backed off and the 4” DP/running tool is laid down.
Immediately after the rotary rig has been moved off the well location, the 7” csg and liner
packer/ hanger are tested to the frac pressure. The testers will rig up and test the tubing head to
5000 psi. Next a test plug will be run and set, using wire line, in the top of the 7” packer/hanger.
Testers will pressure up to our frac pressure, typically 8500 psi, to confirm the 7” is ready for
completion.
