DETAILS OF WORK
On August 29th, 2017, Oasis Petroleum received a letter from the NDIC requiring the above referenced facility is
required to have a perimeter berm erected within 180 days. The above referenced site has a perimeter berm
surrounding the location. Recently, the perimeter berm height was increased and a retention area was built in
northwest corner of the location as part of the continuous efforts made by Oasis Petroleum to maintain the site.
Due to the additional containment Oasis believes the site is in compliance with NDAC Section 43-02-03-49 referenced
in the received letter.
In addition, the site has been evaluated by a Professional Engineer and is in compliance with EPA SPCC regulations
for specific and general site containment (40 CFR 112).

DETAILS OF WORK
After gaining approval from the NDIC, SM Energy completed fracturing operations on the Dahl Federal 2-15H on
5/19/12. SM Energy utilized dual swell packers in the lateral above the top frac port sub located at 11,387' MD to
achieve the 200' isolation setback requirement. No perforating or fracturing stimulation occurred in the blank section
of 4-1/2" production liner above the dual packer assembly located at 11,137' MD. See Completion Form 6 for further
stimulation details.

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Dahl Federal 2-15H is a north lateral Middle Bakken well located NW/NE in SEC 15, T153N,
R101W, in McKenzie County, North Dakota. The primary target zone was 7’- 17’ under the top
of the Middle Bakken Formation. Although the entire Middle Bakken is considered a pay zone,
the target zone is used primarily because of its distinct gamma characteristics which are used to
help directional drill the lateral. Directional and MWD services were performed by Ryan Energy
Company. Joe Hallgren was the well-site geologist providing geo-steering and mudlogging
services were provided by Basin Geologic Consulting, Inc.

DETAILS OF WORK
Follow up to our sundry of 3-21-12: SM Energy requests approval to resume drilling the lateral to TD where a 4-1/2"
liner with swell packers will then be run. With the 7” casing at TD, no circulation was established. The 7" was
perfed in the Carrington at 10,798' - 10,800'MD (10,660° TVD) with 8 holes. Circulation was established. The 7" Csg
was cemented with 167 sx in the first stage and 689 sx of total cement in the second stage putting cmt 500' over the
top of the Dakota. The DV was drilled out at 9336' and the cmt across the perts at 10,798' was drilled out. Csg was
pressure tested to 500 psi. The float collar at 10,866" was drilled out and csg cleaned out to the float shoe at 10,948".
A CIBP was run in and set above the shoe at 10,943". The bottom shoe jt was then perforated at 10,938'-10,936',
10,934’-10,932', 10930'-10,928'. A CICR was set at 10,902" whereby a cmt squeeze was attempted into the
perforations at 10,938' - 10,928", however no injection rate into the perfs was able to be established with a pressure
applied of 1.1 psi/ft (6500 psi surface pressure). At this point SM Energy requests approval to drill out the CICR,
CIBP and the float shoe. The 6' lateral wil! be drilled from 11,009' to an estimated TD of 21,015’. A 4-1/2” liner will be
run with 21 swell packers. Dual swell packers will be run at approximately 11,040' (348' inside the 1280 spacing unit)
with the first frac port sleeve at approximately 11,275".
*SM Energy must request a hearing per NDAC 43-02-03-18.1. SM Energy must accept all liability associated with the above
procedure and ssolation approval is contingent upon a decision rendered by the Commission at a hearing. Cannot frac until
after a hearing and Commission decision.

ISM ENERGY CO. REQUESTS APPROVAL TO PERFORATE THE 7" CASING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING
CIRCULATION IN ORDER TO CEMENT THE 7" CASING. THE 8-3/4" INTERMEDIATE HOLE WAS ORILLED TO ATD OF
41,009" IN THE M. BAKKEN. 7" CASING WAS RUN IN THE HOLE TO A DEPTH OF 10,956’ AT WHICH TIME IT IS
BELIEVED THAT THE U. BAKKEN SHALE HAS BECOME UNSTABLE AND STUCK THE CASING. ATTEMPTS HAVE
BEEN MADE TO FREE THE CASING AND AS MUCH AS 2000 PSI OF PRESSURE HAS BEEN APPLIED, BUT
CIRCULATION IS UNABLE TO BE ESTABLISHED, WE REQUEST THE APPROVAL TO PERFORATE THE 7" CASING @
40,791" MD (10,647' TVD) IN THE CARRINGTON FORMATION ABOVE THE U, BAKKEN SHALE. FIELD EXPERIENCE
HAS PROVEN THAT THIS IS THE LOCATION WITH THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY OF ESTABLISHING CIRCULATION.
BECAUSE THE POINT OF PERFORATION DOES NOT SATISFY THE 200’ SETBACK REQUIREMENT FOR CEMENT
ISOLATION, UPON COMPLETION OF THE PRIMARY CEMENTING JOB, SM ENERGY CO. WILL SQUEEZE CEMENT
AROUND THE CASING SHOE. WE WILL ACCOMPLISH THIS AS FOLLOWS: DRILL OUT THE FLOAT EQUIPMENT,
SET A COMPOSITE BRIDGE PLUG @ APPROXIMATELY 10,950' MD, RUN TUBING CONVEYED PERFORATING GUNS
TO A DEPTH OF 10,940’ MD AND PERFORATE SQUEEZE HOLES, SET A COMPOSITE CEMENT RETAINER @ 10,925"
AND RUN IN WITH DRILLPIPE AND PUMP AND SQUEEZE 44 SACKS OF CEMENT AROUND CASING SHOE. THE
PERFORATION HOLES @ 10,940' MD WILL BE 252’ NORTH OF THE SOUTH LINE OF SEC. 10 - T153N - R101W,

DETAILS OF WORK
SM Energy Company requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under
NDAC 43-02-03-55. SM Energy Company intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set
surface casing with a small drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set ata depth
pre-approved by the NDIC per the Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used In the
drilling and cementing operations of the surface casing. Once the surface casing ts cemented, a plug or mechanical
seal will be placed at the top of the casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of
drilling to TD will move onto the location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing
plan as per the APD. The undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance
with the Subsection 4 of Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAG, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings
and time savings of usinagn initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not
intended to alter or extend the terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oll and gas lease with
acreage in or under the spacing or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. SM Energy Company understands
-| NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be
fenced immediately after construction if the well pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). SM Energy
Company will plug and abandon the well and reclalm the well site If the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig
within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.
