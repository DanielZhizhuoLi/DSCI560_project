The Bakken Formation
The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian] was recorded at 10,967' MD, 10,743’ TVD (-8,608'
MSL). Entry into this member is characterized by high gamma counts (>300 API), elevated background
gas and increased rates of penetration. While drilling through the Upper Bakken Shale gas a background
gas of 1300u was observed, as well as a survey gas of 2319u. The distinct black shale is carbonaceous and
petroliferous, as well as, hard and platy. Minerals including disseminated/nodular pyrite and trace calcite
fracture fill was observed.
The Middle Bakken Member [Mississippian-Devonian] was entered
at 11,026’ MD, 10,759' TVD (-8,624' MSL). Samples in the Middle
Bakken are predominantly a light to medium gray, light brown, and
occasionally cream silty sandstone. The silty sandstone is fine to very
fine grained, friable to occasionally firm. The Middle Bakken
typically contained sub-round to sub-angular grains. Samples are
smooth, moderately sorted and poorly cemented by calcite. Rare to
trace quantities of disseminated and nodular pyrite is present as was
trace to fair intergranular porosity. Trace to rare light-medium
brown, spotty oil stain was visible in many of these samples. While
drilling the Middle Bakken background gasses ranged from ~500 to
4500 units while several shows exceeded 5000u.
Figure 3. Wet sample cuttings of silty sandstone from the Middle Bakken.
Geosteering
Structure maps provided by Oasis Petroleum projected that the structure would be a consistent down dip
averaging 89.38º over the course of the lateral. The steering team anticipated the structure to be down at
89.50º the first 4,000’of vertical section, steepening to an 89.12º to 6,000’ of vertical section, and remaining
near 89.53º for the remainder of the lateral. Due to higher than anticipated build
rates through the curve the wellbore landed only 10’ into the Middle Bakken
and as a result the gamma signatures throughout the middle member were based
on offset wells. Upon exiting casing, and drilling down, it became apparent that
the gamma signature was very similar to that of the Lewis Federal 5300 31-
31H. Since this offset well had the thinnest Middle Bakken (~36’) of the three
offsets it was determined to steer ahead with an anticipated 36’ Middle Bakken,
this technique was also used in drilling the Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 3B. The
target interval was defined by proximity to the shales and not by an ideal
porosity interval. The 16’ target began 10’ below the Upper Bakken Shale and
extended to 10’ above the Lower Bakken Shale. Before drilling out of the 7”
casing it was determined that the cool C marker in the lower half of the target
interval was going to be the most consistent steering guide (Figure 4). The cool
C marker was contacted several times in the lateral. However, over the course
of the lateral the warm B marker and a slightly cool marker near the top of the
target interval proved to be the most beneficial. Near 19,050’ the wellbore
began to build inclination on rotation faster than anticipated and drilled within
~3’ of the Upper Bakken Shale. To avoid contact with the upper member a stop
card was pulled and time drilling was utilized. Regardless of position in zone
the assembly consistently built inclination on rotation. There did not appear to
be any noticeable hard streaks or intervals that were more favorable in relation
to ROP.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum respectfully requests to amend the surface casing depth to 3600' MD (previously 2136') due to
potential flowback in the Dakota formation. In order to counteract projected flowback at surface, Oasis needs to
increase mud weight, and lowering the surface casing point will allow this to be performed safely.
Attached are revised drill plans reflecting the amended casing points, cement volumes, and other related volumes.
DV tool will not be used per Jennifer.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a variance to NDAC 43-02-03-21 for the tubing/packer requirement:
Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately following the upcoming
fracture stimulation.
The following assurances apply:
1. the well is equipped with new 29# and 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi;
2. The Frac design will ise a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure;
3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by montioring equipement;
4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flowback than during the frac job;
5. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates;
6. Production equipment wil! be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing;
7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period
