5301 43-12H offset). Intermittent salt beds were present until the Base Last Salt Marker
(Charles Formation), logged at 9,198’ TVD (-7,107’ MSL, 0° to the Bray 5301 43-12H and
2° low to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets). Within the salts, the UB Marker was penetrated at
9,120’ TVD (-7,029° MSL 6’ low to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 0’ to the Lindvig 1-11HR
offsets). The Ratcliffe interval is a lower member of the Charles Formation found below the
Base Last Salt. The Ratcliffe was logged at 9,230° TVD (-7,139° MSL 0° to the Bray 5301
43-12H offset),
The Mission Canyon Formation (Mississippian Madison Group) was penetrated at 9,418°
TVD (-7,327 MSL, 2° low to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 0” to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets).
This formation consists predominately of limestone with poor intercrystalline porosity and an
earthy texture. The lime mudstone is typically; medium to dark gray, microcrystalline, firm
and contained sections that are partially argillaceous. Trace quantities of anhydrite were also
observed, that were white to off white, soft and amorphous,
The Lodgepole Formation (Mississippian Madison Group) was encountered at 9,975’ TVD (-
7,884 MSL, 3’ high to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 3’ high to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets).
The Lodgepole contain some limestone near the top of the formation, but is dominated
primarily by an argillaceous lime mudstone with common traces of pyrite. The limestone
samples observed were tan, light gray to cream, microcrystalline, earthy texture, and friable
to firm with no visible porosity 1s typically described as a light to medium gray to gray-
brown dense fossiliferous argillaceous limestone with some chert present.
The “False Bakken” Marker (Mississippian Lodgepole Formation) was logged at 10,815'
MD, 10,692’ TVD (-8,601' MSL, 0° to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 6’ low to the Lindvig 1I-
11HR offsets) Typically, The False Bakken facies consisted of very dark gray carbonaceous
shale that is soft to friable with an earthy texture. There is usually common disseminated
pyrite and no visible porosity
The Mississippian-Devonian Bakken Formation is compnsed of two beds of black
carbonaceous petroliferous shale bounding a silty sandstone Middle Member with some
intergranular porosity. The Upper Shale Member was logged at 10,832’ MD, 10,703' TVD (-
8,612’ MSL, 0” to the Bray 5301 43-12H and 9’ low to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets). Sample
returns were black, carbonaceous and petroliferous shale with common disseminated pyrite
and characterized by gamma ray values in excess of ~300 API counts.
The Middle Bakken Member was logged at 10,876’ MD, 10,719' TVD (-8,628’ MSL, 0° to
the Bray 5301 43-12H and 7’ low to the Lindvig 1-11HR offsets). This member is typically
comprised of three distinct lithologies. The first facies encountered was a siltstone
characterized by a high gamma signature. This lithology is located directly below the Upper
Shale Member. A typical description of this zone is a well to moderately sorted dark gray to
gray siltstone with possible intergranular porosity.

Figure 4. Middle Bakken siltstone. Sample depth 10,930” MD viewed under 20x magnification. (Kyle Kavalec,
Sunburst well-site geologist)
The second distinct lithology of the Middle Bakken Member was a fossiliferous limestone
{packstone) with a characteristically low gamma signature ~20 API units. It has a variable
thickness throughout the Williston Basin and lies directly below the siltstone; however this
facies was absent in the Foley Federal 5301 43-12H.
The third lithology of the Middle Bakken Member is silty sandstone usually located below
the packstone, The lithologic description is a light gray to off white to cream with trace
medium gray silty sandstone that is very fine grained to fine grained. This silty sandstone is
moderately sorted with dolomite and calcite cements. In zone a spotty to even oil stain was
present.
The top of this zone exhibited a higher gamma signature than the bottom portion. At the top
1’-2’ of zone gamma signatures ranged from 100’s to 120’s. The middle 1’-2” of the zone
exhibited a lower gamma count ~60 API units. The lower portion of zone displayed counts
in the 90’s to 100’s with very little character. The oil staining observed in sample displayed
similar concentrations throughout the target zone. Within the zone oil stain was descnibed as
common to trace light brown spotty to even

Hydrocarbon Shows
Background gas concentrations observed in the Middle Bakken lateral ranged from
approximately 400 units at the beginning of lateral with a 9.9 ppg mud weight and ~5,000
units towards the end of the lateral with an 10.5 ppg mud weight. Increased background gas
concentrations were most likely due to greater exposure of the wellbore to the target porosity
zone in addition to a lighter mud weight. The highest peak values were observed towards the
second half of the lateral while drilling in the upper portion of the target zone. The highest
peak value observed was 4,477 units at 17,252" MD with a mud weight of 10.5 ppg.
Connection gases within the target zone averaged ~500-2,000 units in the beginning of the
lateral and increased to ~3,000-4,000 units towards the end. The highest connection gas
observed throughout the lateral was 1,539 units at 16,988’ MD. Gas was circulated through
the gas buster throughout the second half of the lateral following a 3,000 unit gas peak during
the middle of the lateral. The Middle Bakken trip gas was the highest trip gas value of 6,421
units observed throughout the well. Light brown spotty oil stain was observed throughout the
target zone lithology. Oil stained samples were immersed in Entron. The samples exhibited
predominantly moderate diffuse pale yellow to green fluorescence. As the samples became
contaminated with lateral lubricant they were not longer evaluated for hydrocarbon cut due to
fact that the lubricant fluid is hydrocarbon based which would cause false fluorescence in the
sample and thus give an inaccurate picture of the amount of hydrocarbons present within the
cuttings. Greenish brown oil was observed coming over the shakers the entire lateral.
Throughout the lateral sidetrack a 4-8’ mntermittent flare was observed.
Geo-steering
Professional Directional provided well site supervision. Professional Directional was utilized
for directional drilling services and for MWD services. Oasis’ office in Houston, directional
drillers and Sunburst geologists worked closely throughout the well to make steering
decisions to maximize the amount of borehole exposure to the pay zone. The Middle Bakken.
Member of the Foley Federal 5301 43-12H is estimated at ~36° thick. The initial target
interval chosen for this well was located 7’ below the upper shale at 10,732’ TVD. After two
Upper Bakken Shale strikes from wild bounces near the top of the zone and the tendency of
the mud motor to build heavily in rotation our target interval dropped to 13’ below the Upper
Bakken Shale. This was for preventing anymore “hard streaks” from bouncing the wellbore
up and out of the zone. The original target zone was chosen based on density porosity logs
from other wells. Stratigraphic location within the target zone was based on gamma ray
values, sample observations, gas shows, and drill rates. Gamma signatures at the very top of
target zone ranged in value from ~100-120 API units. The middle of the target gamma
signatures were consistently in the 60’s. Upon descent into the lower portion of the target,
gamma values observed averaged ~90 API units with very little character. The lowest
gamma lithology was encountered when crossing the center target zone at roughly 12,226”
MD in the lateral. The presence of repeatable gamma markers provided excellent
mechanisms for steering. A dip calculation along the length of the well bore indicated an
overall 0.26° down formation apparent dip

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-
55. Oasis intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drilling mud and set surface casing with a small
drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used in the drilling and cementing operations of
the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APD. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations in accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the
terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oil and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing
or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The lined reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction if the well
pad is located in a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if
the well is not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.
