Comments relative to DST #1 run on Game & Fish #34-3 in McKenzie
County, North Dakota, Sec. 3-15/N-101W for Basic Earth Science
Systems Inc.
The calculations here-in performed were accomplished by plotting the
time and pressure data on semi-log scale and using the resulting
slope and extrapolated pressures from the Horner plot.
Jhe initial formation pressure extrapolated to 4490 psi with a slope
of 243 psi/cycle creating a sub-surface pressure gradient of .488
psi/ft. at the recorder depth of 9206 feet.
The average effective permeability for this zone calculated to 2.32 md.
This was based on 911 feet of 40 API gravity oil being recovered in
100 minutes flowing time. The entire second flow was restricted,
making the fluid recovery and reported gas flow rate low. With the
information available, it is impossible to pinpoint the true flow
rate, permeability, or gas-oil ratio. It is quite possible that this
test could have flowed to surface. The skin factor and damage ratio
numbers are high due to tool restriction and do not suggest any
significant well-bore damage was present at the time of this test.
If you should have any questions concerning this test, please do not
hesitate to call, We appreciate your work and look forward to serving
you again.
