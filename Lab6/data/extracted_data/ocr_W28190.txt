Offset Control
Offset well data can be found in the ‘Control Data’ section appended to this report. Offset wells were
essential in providing control, making it possible to develop a prognosis of formation tops and curve landing
target depth. The three primary offsets were, The Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC Lewis Federal 5300
21-31 5B, the Oasis Petroleum North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 31-31H, and the Oasis Petroleum
North America, LLC, Lewis Federal 5300 11-31 4BR. By referencing the gamma signature of these offsets
and using formation thicknesses, a model was formed for the target interval pinpointing a strategic landing.
Formation thicknesses expressed by gamma ray signatures in these offset wells were compared to gamma
data collected during drilling operations in to successfully land the curve.
Geology
Sample evaluation began in the Otter Formation at 8,230’ measured depth (MD). Lagged samples were
caught by Sunburst personnel in 30’ intervals through the vertical and curve, and 50’ intervals in the lateral.
Rock samples were evaluated under wet and dry conditions using a stereo zoom binocular microscope for
the identification of lithology including the presence of porosity and oil. Only observed prospective intervals
are described here, but detailed lithological descriptions for all formations are provided in the ‘Lithology’
appendix.
The Mission Canyon Formation [Mississippian, Madison Group]
was logged at 9,515' MD, 9,465’ TVD (-7,308' MSL). The Mission
Canyon Formation is described as light gray, cream, tan, and light
brown gray in color. Samples are predominately microcrystalline
and are a firm to friable mudstone. The limestone has an earthy,
rarely crystalline texture. Also noted in in several samples were trace
fossil fragments. The limestone is argillaceous in part throughout
this interval. In certain areas possible intercrystalline porosity was
noted but there was no significant oil staining observed in samples.
Throughout the Mission Canyon gas shows are promising, with an
average background gasses ~110u with several connection gasses
exceeding 200u.
Figure 2. Wet sample cuttings of limestone from the Mission Canyon.
The Bakken Formation
The Upper Bakken Shale Member [Mississippian] was recorded at 10,995' MD, 10,759’ TVD (-8,602'
MSL). Entry into this member is characterized by high gamma counts (>300 API), elevated background
gas and increased rates of penetration. While drilling through the Upper Bakken Shale gas a background
gas of 1000u was observed, as well as a gas show exceeding 1700u. The distinct black shale is carbonaceous
and petroliferous, as well as, hard and platy. Minerals including disseminated/nodular pyrite and trace
calcite fracture fill was observed.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum respectfully requests to amend the surface casing depth to 3300' MD (previously (2157') due to
potential flowback in the Dakota formation. In order to counteract projected flowback at surface, Oasis needs to
increase mud weight, and lowering the surface casing point will allow this to be performed safely. ADV tool will not
be used.
Attached are revised drill plans reflecting the amended casing points, cement volumes, and other related volumes.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis Petroleum North America LLC requests a variance to NDAC 43-02-03-21 for the tubing/packer requirement:
Casing, tubing, and cementing requirements during the completion period immediately following the upcoming
fracture stimulation.
The following assurances apply:
1. the well is equipped with new 29# and 32# casing at surface with an API burst rating of 11,220 psi;
2. The Frac design will ise a safety factor of 0.85 API burst rating to determine the maximum pressure;
3. Damage to the casing during the frac would be detected immediately by montioring equipement;
4. The casing is exposed to significantly lower rates and pressures during flowback than during the frac job;
§. The frac fluid and formation fluids have very low corrosion and erosion rates;
6. Production equipment will be installed as soon as possible after the well ceases flowing;
7. A 300# gauge will be installed on the surface casing during the flowback period

Must run a CBL on the 9-5/8a€ intermediate string which is proposed to isolate the Dakota Group prior to running
7" casing.
TD Change: 20945' MD / 10860 TVD (Previously 20792' MD / 10872' TVD)
Oasis must submit plat of production CTB within 30 days of 4-24-2018.
Please see attached supporting documents.
The East 150' setback is based on a production liner cemented in the lateral with a wet shoe and the ability to frac
out the shoe.

DETAILS OF WORK
Oasis requests permission for suspension of drilling for up to 90 days for the referenced well under NDAC 43-02-03-
55. Oasis Intends to drill the surface hole with freshwater based drllllng mud and set surface casing with a small
drilling rig and move off within 3 to 5 days. The casing will be set at a depth pre-approved by the NDIC per the
Application for Permit to Drill NDAC 43-02-03-21. No saltwater will be used In the drilling and cementing operations of
the surface casing. Once the surface casing is cemented, a plug or mechanical seal will be placed at the top of the
casing to prevent any foreign matter from getting Into the well. A rig capable of drilling to TD will move onto the
location within the 90 days previously outlined to complete the drilling and casing plan as per the APO. The
undersigned states that this request for suspension of drilling operations In accordance with the Subsection 4 of
Section 43-02-03-55 of the NDAC, Is being requested to take advantage of the cost savings and time savings of using
an initial rig that is smaller than the rig necessary to drill a well to total depth but is not intended to alter or extend the
terms and conditions of, or suspend any obligation under, any oll and gas lease with acreage in or under the spacing
or drilling unit for the above-referenced well. Oasis understands NDAC 43-02-03-31 requirements regarding
confidentiality pertaining to this permit. The llned reserve pit will be fenced immediately after construction If the well
pad Is located In a pasture (NDAC 43-02-03-19 & 19.1). Oasis will plug and abandon the well and reclaim the well site if
the well ls not drilled by the larger rotary rig within 90 days after spudding the well with the smaller drilling rig.
Oasis must notify NDIC Field Inspector Richard Dunn @701-770-3554 with spud and TD.
