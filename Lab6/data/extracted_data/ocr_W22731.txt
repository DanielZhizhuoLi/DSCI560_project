DETAILS OF WORK
Slawson Exploration Company, Inc. is panning to begin reclamation work on the reserve pit of this well. The surface
owner is the State of North Dakota. Any oil in the pit will be skimmed off and used in Invert Mud for drilling other wells.
The water will be disposed of by Slawson at various licensed Slawson injection facilities, such as the Sanish 1-9SWD.
Once the fluids are removed the cuttings were dried and mixed with fly ash for stabilzation. The liner will then be folded
over the stabilized cuttings in the pit and buried approximately 6 ft. deep with back fill and topsoil. The site will then re-
seeded. This construction will be completed by one of the three following contractors pending availability.
1. Gold Star Production Services, LLC, 6219, 39th Street NW, Plaza, ND, 58771
2. FMR Services Inc., 3767 County Road 99W, Orland, CA, 95963

The “False Bakken” was penetrated at 10,762’ TVD (-8,584’), evidence of a 10,804’ TVD
target depth. The underlying Scallion interval showed gas peaks as high as 1,947 units.
The Upper Shale of the Bakken Formation [Mississippian – Devonian] was drilled at 10,772’
TVD (-8,594’), supporting a casing point of 10,805’ TVD. The Bakken came in 2’ low to the
Magnum 2-36-25H. Sample returns were typical black, carbonaceous, and petroliferous shale
(Figure 6), characterized by gamma ray values in excess of 400 API. Total gas readings
displayed peaks up to 477 units with background measurements ranging between 250 and 350
units. Samples were described as:
SHALE: black, firm to friable, sub blocky to sub platy, earthy texture, petroliferous, carbonaceous,
abundant disseminated pyrite, nodular pyrite, no visible porosity.
Figure 6: Photograph of typical black carbonaceous
Bakken Shale.
The Middle Member of the Bakken Formation was penetrated at 10,970’ MD, (10,787 TVD),
2’ low to the Magnum 2-36-25H, evidence supporting a target of 10,805’ TVD (Table 1). While
drilling the Magnum 3-36-25H, samples varied only slightly within the target area. Some
differences in oil staining could be seen. The targeted interval consisted of a series of high
gamma (110-120 API) and cool gamma (85-95 API) intervals stacked upon one another.
Commonly in the high gamma markers samples would consist of silty sandstone mixed with
light gray siltstone stringers. The facies of cool gamma were primarily well cemented sandstone
with marker F2 showing occasional stringers of lime packstone. Samples collected from the
Middle Bakken (Figure 7& 8) were described as:
SILTSTONE: medium brown, friable to trace firm, sub blocky to sub platy, calcareous cement, poorly to
trace moderately cemented, trace disseminated pyrite, no visible porosity.
SILTY SANDSTONE: cream to off white, very fine grained, friable to trace firm, sub angular to sub
rounded, well sorted, calcareous cement, poorly to trace moderately cemented, trace disseminated pyrite,
possible intergranular porosity, trace dark brown spotty oil stain .
Decreasing background gas levels were less than half of previous measurements, around 150
units with connections barely averaging over 250 units. The decrease in gas did coincide with a
very slight decrease in oil staining and a more common hardening of calcite cement. It is
possible that the increased cementing caused porosity occlusion. Relatively low gas levels would
continue until roughly 16,900’ MD when they began to rise despite being low within the target
interval. The average background gas would hover around 350-400 units, but connections
lowered slightly to 400-500 units. Gas levels were higher here then any previous trips to bottom
of our targeted interval.
Gas levels would remain steady over the next 1,000’ before decreasing slightly. By 18,300’ MD,
average background gas was less then 300 units and connections were barely distinguishable. At
this point in the lateral the bit had just reentered the bottom of the targeted interval. As the
wellbore climbed in section gas levels would increase. Beginning at 18,700’ MD, gas levels
climbed briefly, approaching 600 units, before declining and leveling off around 18,850 MD.
Hydrocarbon gas levels remained steady with backgrounds averaging of 250-300 units and
occasionally as high as 400 units. While the wellbore approached TD, the bit began climbing
aggressively. It soon passed to its highest point within zone and background levels increased to a
lateral high. The average background would reach 500+ units with connections over 800 units.
During the lateral there were three trips to surface for BHA changes. The change-outs allowed
for the recording of trip gases of 1,017, 3,081, and 1,388 units. The second was punctuated by a
10’-15’ flare.
Marker F1: This marker made up the first 2’ of the zone (Note: See Figure 11 for visual
representation of this section). Overlying Marker F1 was a dark siltstone with trace spotty brown
oil stain and low porosity. Increases in pyrite and gray sandstone were also observed. Decreased
oil staining and intergranular porosity was common in this marker.
Marker F2: Marker F2 began about 3’ into the target zone and continued until 5’ into zone. This
facies was encountered early in the tangent section before setting casing. It was similar in nearly
every way to Marker F4. Common characteristics of this marker were increasing white to cream
sandstone and increasing pyrite levels. On occasion this marker would contain trace amounts of
lime packstone. It is important to note that exceptional porosity was observed in offset electric
logs within this interval, showing porosity up to 13%. It is unclear how permeable this interval
is, but with production fracturing the increased porosity will likely benefit overall production.
Typically within this marker, rare to occasional spotty brown oil staining was seen with areas of
spotty black oil stain. This marker shared gamma characteristics with F4 and F6, averaging 85-
95 API.
Marker F3: Marker F3 extended from 4’-6’ into the target. This marker appeared slightly
warmer then surrounding markers reaching 105-110 API. Samples were identical to that of
Marker F1. Trace to rare light brown oil staining was typical, but occasionally increased to
include spotty light black staining. Some hydrocarbon staining may have been obscured by the
darker colors of the sandstone in this marker. Hydrocarbon gas levels were generally higher in
the warm gamma intervals found at Markers F3 and F5. This may be due to the tight nature of
the cream and off white sandstones found in the low gamma intervals.
Marker F4: The F4 marker began about 6’ from the top of zone and in the lateral averaged a 95-
105 API gamma signature. The lower cool gamma marker did not show staining that would set it
apart for other areas within zone. Cream to off white sandstone made up the majority of samples
examined in this marker. The sandstone was identical to marker F2 though packstone was never
observed within this interval.
Marker F5: Marker F5 ranged from 9’-12’ below the top of zone. This marker made up the last
3’ of zone, comprised of sand and siltstones much like Marker F1. Proceeding downward
through section in this marker, gamma measurements increased above 120 API, indicating an
exit from the bottom of zone. Sands within this interval showed trace dark brown oil stain. The
siltstones show virtually no oil staining and were tight in nature with grayish brown coloration.

from the near-by Fossum well.
Geo-Steering
The target zone within the Middle Bakken is defined as the 14’ zone below gamma marker
“MBKMGR” (Marker F1; Figure 11). The target zone in the Middle Bakken was established
based on the samples and electric logs from nearby offset wells. Prognosis predicted 35’ of
viable zone between the Bakken shales, the first 13’ of which is above the desired target. The
Magnum 3-36-25H required turning the lateral from northwest to due north shortly after exiting
intermediate casing which resulted in the implementation of slides purely for azimuth. The initial
prognosis called for a regional dip of a nearly flat 0.09º down which predicted the pay zone to
drop ~16’ over the course of the two section lateral. Gamma markers from a large collection of
offset data showed little to no definition within the targeted interval. As the lateral progressed,
the low gamma valleys of makers F2, F4, and F6 became the most recognizable.
The bit exited the Upper Bakken Shale at 10,970’ MD (10,787’ TVD) and passed into the top of
the target interval at 11,017’ MD (Note: See Figure for visual representation of this section). The
wellbore landed at a casing point of 11,128’ MD (10,810’ TVD), approximately 23’ into the
